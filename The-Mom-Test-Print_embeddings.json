 INTRODUCTION Trying to learn from customer conversations is like excavating a delicate archaeological site. The truth is down there somewhere,\nbut it’s fragile. While each blow with your shovel gets you closer\nto the truth, you’re liable to smash it into a million little pieces if youuse too blunt aninstrument.  I see a lot of teams using a bulldozer and crate of dynamite\nfor their excavation. They are, in one way or another, forcing people to say something nice about their business. They use\nheavy-handed questions like “do you think it’s a good idea” and\nshattertheirprize.  At the other end of the spectrum, some founders are using a toothbrush to unearth a city, flinching away from digging deep\nand finding out whether anything of value is actually buried\ndownthere. We want to find the truth of how to make our business\nsucceed. We need to dig for it—and dig deep—but every question\nwe ask carries the very real possibility of biasing the person we’re\ntalking to and rendering the whole exercise pointless.

INTRODUCTION  The truth is our goal and questions are our tools. But we must\nlearn to wield them. It’s delicate work. And well worth learning.\nThere’streasure below. \nTALKING TO CUSTOMERS IS HARD We know we ought to talk to customers. Many of us even do talk to customers. But we still end up building stuff nobody buys. Isn’t\nthatexactlywhattalking topeopleismeantto prevent?  It turns out almost all of us are doing it wrong. I’ve made these mistakes myself and seen them happen a hundred times\nover with other founders. Despite the recent explosion of startup\nknowledge, the process of figuring out what customers want too oftenunfoldsasitdid atmyfirstcompany, Habit.  We were building social advertising tech and I was\ndistraught. We'd spent 3 years working our hearts out. We’d nearly run out of investor money and it didn’t look like we’d be\ngetting more. We’d relocated internationally to be closer to our\nmarket and had survived a co-founder being deported. I’d been talking to customers full-time for months. And then, after innu‐\nmerable days of slog and an exhausted team, I learned I’d been\ndoingitwrong.Imay aswellnothave bothered. The advice that you “should talk to customers” is well-inten‐\ntioned, but ultimately a bit unhelpful. It’s like the popular kid\nadvising his nerdy friend to “just be cooler.” You still have to\nknowhowtoactually do it. These conversations take time, are easy to screw up and go\nwrong in a nefarious way. Bad customer conversations aren’t just\nuseless. Worse, they convince you that you’re on the right path. They give you a false positive that causes you to over-invest your\ncash, your time, and your team.

INTRODUCTION \nhelp you see where you might be messing stuff up in unnoticed\nways.  Finally, this is a practical handbook, not a theoretical tome.\nFor example, how do you find people to talk to and set up the meetings? How do you take notes while still being polite and\npaying attention? It’s allinhere.  I can’t teach you how to make your business huge. That’s up to you. But I can give you the tools to talk to customers, navigate\nthe noise, and learn what they really want. The saddest thing that\ncan happen to a startup is for nobody to care when it disappears. We’re going to make sure that doesn’thappen. \nA NOTE ON SCOPE & TERMINOLOGY This book isn’t a summary or description or re-interpretation of\nthe process of Customer Development. That’s a bigger concept and something Steve Blank has covered comprehensively in 4\nSteps to the EpiphanyandThe Startup Owner’sManual.  This book is specifically about how to properly talk to customers and learn from them. Talking is one of the big aspects\nof Customer Development, but shouldn't be confused with the\nwhole process. To keep the distinction clear, I’m going to refer to chatting with people as “customer conversation” (lowercase)\ninstead of “Customer Development” (uppercase).  For the most part, I'm assuming you already agree that talking\nto customers is a good idea. I’m not trying to convince you again, so this book is more “how”than“why”.

THE MOM TEST  Son: “Yes, definitely. Thanksmom — love you!”Ihave  completelymis-interpreted this conversation and taken it  as validation.  Mom: “Won’tyouhavesomelasagna?” Iam concerned  thatyouwon’t beableto afford food soon. Please eat  something.  Our misguided entrepreneur has a few more conversations\nlike this, becomes increasingly convinced he’s right, quits his job, and sinks his savings into the app. Then he wonders why nobody\n(evenhismom)buysit, especially since he had beensorigorous.  Doing it wrong is worse than doing nothing at all. When you know you’re clueless, you tend to be careful. But collecting a\nfistful of false positives is like convincing a drunk he’s sober: not\nanimprovement. Let’s fix the conversation and show that if we do it right, even\nmom canhelpus figureoutwhetherour business is agoodidea. \nPASSING THE MOM TEST Son: “Hey mom, how’sthatnew iPad treatingyou?” Mom: “Oh-Iloveit!Iuseit every day.”  Son: “Whatdoyouusually doonit?” Whoops — we  asked a genericquestion, so answer to this probably won’t  beterribly valuable.

ROB FITZPATRICK Son: “What’s the last thing youdid onit?”Getspecific aboutexamples in the past to get real, concretedata. Mom: “Youknow your father and I are planningthat trip? I wasfiguring out where we could stay.”She uses it\nfor both entertainment and utility, which didn’tcome up\nduring the “usually” answer. \nSon: “Did youuse anapp for that?”A slightly leading\nquestion, butsometimes we need to nudge to getto the\ntopic we’re interestedin. \nMom: “No, I just used Google. I didn’t know there was\nanapp. What’s it called?”Younger folks use the App Store\nas a search engine, whereas your mom waits for aspecific recommendation. If that’s true more broadly, finding a\nreliable marketing channeloutside the App Store is going\nto be crucial. \nSon: “How did youfind out about the other apps you\nhave?”Dig into interesting and unexpected answers to understand the behaviours and motivations behind them. Mom: “The Sunday paper has a sectiononthe apps of\nthe week.”You can’t remember the last time you opened a paper, butitsounds like traditionalPR might be aviable\noption for reaching customerslikemom.\nSon: “Makes sense.

 THE MOM TEST  Mom: “They’re one of those things youjust end up  getting at Christmas. I think Marcy gave me that one.  Haven’t evenopened it. As if I need another lasagna  recipe at my age!”Aha! This answer is golden for 3 reasons: 1. Old people don’t need another generic setof  recipes. 2. The gift market may be strong . 3. Younger  cooks may be a better customer segmentsince they don’t yetknow thebasics. Son: “What’s the last cookbook youdid buy for your‐ self?”Attack generic answers like “Idon’tbuy cookbooks”  by asking for specificexamples.  Mom: “Now that youmentionit, I bought a vegancook‐  book about 3 months ago. Your father is tryingto eat  healthier and thought my veggies could benefit from a pinch more zazz.”More gold: experienced chefs may still  buy specialised or nichecookbooks.  The conversation continues. If it’s going well, I would raise\nthe topics of whether she has ever looked for recipes on the iPad\nor searched for cooking videos onYouTube.  You thank her for the lasagna, pet the dog, and head home. You’ve learned that building an app and waiting for people to\nfind it on the App Store probably isn’t a good plan. But you’ve got\nsome good insight about your customer segment and a few promising leads to look into.

 ROB FITZPATRICK Our original idea looked like this: old people like cookbooks and iPads. Therefore, we will build a cookbook for the iPad. It’s\ngeneric. There are athousandpossible variationsof this premise.  With an idea this vague, we can’t answer any of the diffi‐ cult questions like which recipes to include or how people will\nhear about it. Until we get specific, it always seems like a\ngood idea.  After just one conversation (with our mom, of all people), we have a higher fidelity vision. We now see that there are at least 2\nspecific customer segments we might serve, each of which needs a\nslightly different product. We’ve also identified some major risks toaddressbefore we committoo heavily.  1. We couldofferniche recipes(ethnic, diets) which  experiencedcooksmaynotalreadyknow. Our biggestquestion ishow toreach them when they  don’tsearch forapps. We have apossible leadwith  newspaperandmagazine PR.  2. Alternately, we mightmake generic recipesfor  youngercookswhoare easiertoreach viathe App  Store andwhohaven’tmemorisedalltheirfavourites yet. We haven’ttalkedtoany, sowe have loadsof  questions, butone big one mightbe whethera  customersegmentwhoisn’talreadyin the habitof  buying expensive cookbookswillpayapremium forours. The first conversation gave us rope to hang ourselves. The second gave us actionable insight. Why? What was different\naboutthe secondconversation?  Mom was unable to lie to us because we never talked about\nour idea. That’s kind of weird, right?

THE MOM TEST better ones? Now, take all that information and decide for your‐ self whetherit’sa good idea. Ruleofthumb: Opinionsare worthless. \n\"Would you buy a product which did X?\" Bad question. You’re asking for opinions and hypotheticals\nfrom overly optimistic people who want to make you happy. The\nanswer to a question like this is almost always “yes”, which makes it worthless.  Let’s fix it: Ask how they currently solve X and how much it\ncosts them to do so. And how much time it takes. Ask them to talk you through what happened the last time X came up. If they\nhaven’t solved the problem, ask why not. Have they tried\nsearching for solutions and found them wanting? Or do they not\neven care enough tohave Googledfor it? Rule of thumb: Anything involving the future is an over-opti‐ mistic lie. \n\"How much would you pay for X?\" Bad question. This is exactly as bad as the last one, except it’s\nmore likely to trick you because the number makes it feel rigorous\nandtruthy. How to fix it: Just like the others, fix it by asking about their\nlife as it already is. How much does the problem cost them? How\nmuch do they currently pay to solve it? How big is the budget they’ve allocated?

 ROB FITZPATRICK Rule of thumb: People will lie to you if they think it’s what you wanttohear. \"What would your dream product do?\"  Sort-of-okay question, but only if you ask good follow-ups.\nOtherwise it’s a bad question. A question like this is like the “set”\nbefore the spike in a volleyball game: not too helpful on its own, but it puts you in a good position as long as you’re ready to\nexploit it.  Let’s improve it: The value comes from understanding why they want these features. You don’t want to just collect feature\nrequests. You aren’t building the product by committee. But the\nmotivationsandconstraintsbehindthose requestsare critical. Rule of thumb: People know what their problems are, but they\ndon’tknow how tosolve those problems. \"Why do you bother?\" Good question. I love this sort of question. It’s great for\ngetting from the perceivedproblem tothe realone.  For example, some founders I knew were talking to finance\nguys spending hours each day sending emails about their spread‐ sheets. The finance guys were asking for better messaging tools so\nthey could save time. The “why do you bother” question led to\n“so we can be certain that we’re all working off the latest version.” Aha.

THE MOM TEST Rule of thumb: You're shooting blind until you understand their goals. \"What are the implications of that?\"  Good question. This distinguishes between I-will-pay-to-\nsolve-that problems and thats-kind-of-annoying-but-I-can-deal-\nwith-it “problems”. Some problems have big, costly implications. Others exist but don’t actually matter. It behooves you to find out\nwhichiswhich.Italsogivesyouagoodpricingsignal.  I once had someone keep describing the workflow we were fixing with emotionally loaded terms like “DISASTER”, accom‐\npanied by much yelling and arm waving. But when I asked him\nwhat the implications were, he sort of shrugged and said “Oh, we just ended up throwing a bunch of interns at the problem—it’s\nactuallyworking prettywell.” Ruleofthumb:Someproblemsdon’tactually matter. \"Talk me through the last time that happened.\"  Good question. Your high school writing teacher may have\ntold you that stories are meant to “show, not tell”. Whenever\npossible, you want to be shown, not told, by your customers. Learn through their actions instead of their opinions. If you ran a\nburger joint, it would be stupid to survey your customers about\nwhether they prefer cheeseburgers or hamburgers. Just watch what they buy (but if you’re trying to understand why they prefer\noneovertheother,you’llhavetotalk to them).  Folks can’t be wishy-washy when you’re watching them do the task in question.

 ROB FITZPATRICK But if you can’t get in there, asking them to talk you through the lasttimeithappenedisstilla huge help.  Being walked through their full workflow answers many\nquestions in one fell swoop: how do they spend their days, what tools do they use, and who do they talk to? What are the\nconstraints of their day and life? How does your product fit into\nthat day? Which other tools, products, software, and tasks does\nyourproductneedtointegrate with? Rule of thumb: Watching someone do a task will show you where the problems and inefficiencies really are, not where the customer\nthinks theyare. \"What else have you tried?\"  Good question. What are they using now? How much does it\ncost and what do they love or hate about it? How much would those fixes be worth and how traumatic would it be for them to\nswitchtoanew solution?  I was checking out an idea with a potential customer and they excitedly said, “Oh man, that happens all the time. I would\ndefinitelypayforsomething whichsolvedthat problem.”  That’s a future-promise statement without any commitment\nto back it up, so I needed to learn whether it was true or not. I asked, “When’s the last time this came up?” Turns out, it was\npretty recent. That’s a great sign. To dig further, I asked, “Can\nyou talk me through how you tried to fix it?” He looked at me blankly,soInudgedhim further.  “Did you google around for any other ways to solve it?” He\nseemed a little bit like he’d been caught stealing from the cookie\njar and said, “No… I didn’t really think to.

THE MOM TEST In the abstract, it’s something he would “definitely” pay to solve. Once we got specific, he didn't even care enough to search\nforasolution(whichdoexist,incidentally).  It’s easy to get someone emotional about a problem if you lead them there. “Don’t you hate when your shoelaces come\nuntied while you’re carrying groceries?” “Yeah, that’s the worst!”\nAnd then I go off and design my special never-come-untied laces\nwithout realising that if you actually cared, you would already be using adouble-knot. Rule of thumb: If they haven't looked for ways of solving it\nalready,they'renotgoing tolookfor(or buy)yours. \"Would you pay X for a product which did Y?\"  Bad question. The fact that you’ve added a number doesn’t\nhelp. This is bad for the same reasons as the others: people are overly optimistic about what they would do and want to make\nyouhappy.Plus,it’saboutyourideainsteadof theirlife.  Let’s fix it: As always, ask about what they already do now, not what they believe they might do in the future. Common\nwisdom is that you price your product in terms of value to the\ncustomer rather than cost to you. That's true. And you can't quan‐\ntify the value received without prodding their financial worldview.  Another way to fix it, if you’re far enough along, is to literally\nask for money.

 ROB FITZPATRICK \"How are you dealing with it now?\" Good question. Beyond workflow information, this gives you\na price anchor. If they’re paying £100/month for a duct-tape\nworkaround, you know which ballpark you're playing in. On the other hand, they may have spent £120,000 this year on agency\nfees to maintain a site you're replacing. If that's the case, you don't\nwanttobehaving the£100 conversation.  Sometimes, both of the above will be happening simultane‐ ously and you get to choose how you present yourself. Do you\nwant to be a replacement for the web app at a yearly value of\n£1.2korfortheagencyat100x that? Rule of thumb: While it’s rare for someone to tell you precisely what they’ll pay you, they’ll often show you what it’s worth\nto them. \"Where does the money come from?\"  Good question. This isn't something you would necessarily\nask a consumer (though you might), but in a B2B context it’s a must-ask. It leads to a conversation about whose budget the\npurchase will come from and who else within their company\nholdsthepowertotorpedothe deal.  Often, you'll find yourself talking to someone other than the budget owner. Your future pitches will hit unseen snags unless\nyou learn who else matters and what they care about.

THE MOM TEST \nup the first few conversations can be challenging, but if you’re\nonto something interesting and treating people well, your leads\nwillquicklymultiplyviaintros.  If someone doesn’t want to make intros, that’s cool too. Just leave them be. You’ve learned that you’re either screwing up the\nmeeting (probably by being too formal, pitchy, or clingy) or they\ndon’t actually care about the problem you’re solving. Take anything nicetheysaywithanextragrainof salt. \"Is there anything else I should have asked?\"  Good question. Usually, by the end of the meeting, people\nunderstand what you’re trying to do. Since you don’t know the industry, they’ll often be sitting there quietly while you\ncompletelymissthemostimportant point.  Asking this question gives them a chance to politely “fix” yourlineofquestioning.And theywill!  This question is a bit of a crutch: you’ll discard it as you get\nbetter at asking good questions and as you get to know the industry. Rule of thumb: People want to help you. Give them an excuse to\ndoso. \nUSING THE MOM TEST You’ll notice that none of the good questions were about asking\nwhat you should build. One of the recurring “criticisms” about talking to customers is that you’re abdicating your creative vision\nand building your product by committee.

 ROB FITZPATRICK  The questions to ask are about your customers’ lives: their\nproblems, cares, constraints, and goals.

 ROB FITZPATRICK \nback on track by deflecting compliments, anchoring fluff, and\ndigging beneathideas. \nDEFLECTING COMPLIMENTS Most of your meetings will end with a compliment. It feels good.\nTheysaidthey liked it! Unfortunately, they’re almost certainly lying. Not necessarily\nintentionally. They might want to be supportive or to protect\nyourfeelings.Oryourexcitementmightberubbingoffon them. Even if they really do like it, that data is still worthless. For\nexample, venture capitalists (professional judges of the future) are\nwrong far more than right. If even a VC's opinion is probably wrong,whatweightcouldthatofsomerandomguy'spossiblyhave?  With the exception of industry experts who have built very\nsimilar businesses, opinions are worthless. You want facts and commitments,notcompliments.

If they happen anyway, you need to deflect the compliment and get on\nwiththe businessof gathering factsand commitments.

 THE MOM TEST that?”This is a bit generic and isn’t the world’s greatest question, but I’m trying tofind an anchor to learn about  workflow inefficiencies and bumps. When Ifind one, I’ll  dig around that signalwith morefollow-ups.  Them: (Evenmore workflow and alternate solutiondata) If we’re early in the learning process, the meeting could end here quite happily. We have the learning we came for. If we’re\nslightly later-stage and already have a product, we might continue\nby zooming inand pushing for commitmentsorsales. Remember though: you don’t need to end up with what you\nwanted to hear in order to have a good conversation. You just\nneed to get to the truth. Here’s a good conversation with a solid\nnegative result. A good (negative) conversation:  Them: “That’s really cool. I love it.”Compliment.

We kind of  just ignore it.”The implications of the problem are non-  existentso I’m not in the market for asolution.

 ROB FITZPATRICK \nfigure out whether it’s an industry-wide non-problem or some‐\nthingspecific to them.  Did you notice that in the conversations above, practically\nevery response contains a sneaky compliment? They are perva‐ sive, constantly trying to trick us into thinking the meeting\n“wentwell”.  Ignoring compliments should be easy, but it’s not. We crave validation and, as such, are often tricked into registering compli‐\nments as reliable data instead of vacuous fibs. Sometimes it’s\neasier to spot the symptoms than to notice the sneaky compli‐ mentitself. Symptoms (in the meeting): “Thanks!” “I’m gladyou like it.” \nSymptoms (back at the ofﬁce):  “Thatmeeting wentreallywell.”  “We’re getting alotof positive feedback.”  “EverybodyI’ve talkedtoloves theidea.”  All of these are warning signs. If you catch yourself or your\nteammates saying something like this, try to get specific. Why did\nthat person like the idea? How much money would it save him? How would it fit into his life?

THE MOM TEST \nRule of thumb: Compliments are the fool’s gold of customer\nlearning: shiny, distracting, and worthless. \nANCHORING FLUFF Fluff comesin 3 cuddly shapes:  Generic claims(“I usually”, “I always”, “Inever”)  Future-tense promises(“I would”, “Iwill”)  Hypotheticalmaybes(“I might”, “Icould”)  When someone starts talking about what they “always” or\n“usually” or “never” or “would” do, they are giving you generic and hypothetical fluff. Ask good questions that obey The Mom\nTest to anchor them back to specifics in the past. Ask when it last\nhappened or for them to talk you through it. Ask how they solved itandwhatelse theytried.  The world’s most deadly fluff is: “I would definitely\nbuythat.” It just sounds so concrete. As a founder, you desperately want\nto believe it’s money in the bank. But folks are wildly optimistic\nabout what they would do in the future. They’re always more positive, excited, and willing to pay in the imagined future than\ntheyare once thatfuture arrives.  The first startup I worked at fell for the “I would definitely\nbuy that” trap and subsequently lost about 10 million bucks. They mistook fluffy future promises and excited compliments for\ncommitment. They incorrectly believed they had proven them‐\nselvesrightandwildlyover-invested.

ROB FITZPATRICK “Doyouever…” “Would youever…”  “Whatdoyou usually…”  “Doyouthink you…” “Might you…”  “Couldyousee yourself…” You don’t need to avoid these questions 100% of the time. They aren’t exactly toxic. It’s just that the responses are useless.\nThe mistake is in valuing the answers, not in asking the ques‐\ntions. In fact, sometimes these questions can help you transition intomore concrete questioning. Transitioning from a ﬂuffy question to a concrete\none: You: “DoyoueverX?”Afluff-inducing question.  Them: “Oh yeah, allthe time.”Afluffyanswer which has  novalueinitself, but which wecananchor from.  You: “When’s the last time that happened?” We use  The Mom Test and ask for a concrete example in  the past.

THE MOM TEST \nanchor them on the life they already lead and the actions they’re\nalready taking. \nDIGGING BENEATH IDEAS Entrepreneurs are always drowning in ideas. We have too many\nideas, not too few. Still, folks adore giving us more. At some point during a good conversation, the person you’re talking to may\n“flip” to your side of the table. This is good news. They are\nexcited and see the potential, so they’ll start listing tons of ideas, possibilitiesandfeaturerequests.  Write them down, but don’t rush to add them to your todo\nlist. Startups are about focusing and executing on a single, scal‐ able idea rather than jumping on every good one which crosses\nyour desk.  Let’ssayyou’remid-conversationwhenthis ideadrops:  Them:“Areyouguysgoing tobeabletosync toExcel? I  reallythinkthat’sthekiller feature.”  What do you do here? The wrong response is to write “sync\nto Excel” on your todo list and then move on. That’s the fast-lane to feature-creep. Instead, take a moment to dig into the motiva‐\ntionsbehindthe request.

THE MOM TEST the same stupid analytics report. And every week, I would do so while politely explaining that, you know, we built this awesome\nself-serve dashboard so they could have their data whenever they\nwanted.Andthen,thenextFriday,they’d call. It turned out we had entirely missed the real reason they’d\nbeen excited about our analytics demo. In fact, we'd missed their\nwholemotivationforwanting analyticsinthefirst place.  The memory of being burned by feature requests was still fresh in my mind when they asked if we could add their logo and\ncolours to the reports. I asked a couple incredulous questions\nabout why in the world they wanted this feature when they didn’t even use the ones we had already built. I felt like an exas‐\nperated Dad at Christmas: “But you don’t even play with the toys\nIboughtforyour birthday!”  So, I finally—and inadvertently—did the smart thing when I asked, “Why do you want this feature? What do branded reports\nget you that unbranded ones don’t? It’s the same data, right?”\nThey replied, “Oh yeah, of course. I mean, nobody even reads these. Our clients just like to get something emailed to them at\nthe end of every week and we think they’d be happier if it was a\nbitfancier,youknow?”Iknewexactly. They had asked for analytics. We had jumped to the conclu‐\nsion that they wanted to better understand their data. But they\nhad really just wanted a way to keep their own clients happy. If\nwe had properly understood that, we would have built a totally different(andmuchsimpler)setof features.  Consider how much easier our lives would have been if we’d\nunderstood the motivation behind the request. Instead of enabling the exploration and export of all campaign data, we\ncould have just always exported the few high-level numbers a big\nbrand manager would be interested in. And instead of a self-serve\ndashboard, we could set up a little scheduler to send it to them every Friday.

 ROB FITZPATRICK And instead of coding up a layout and branding system for the reports, we could have had an intern hand-build them each week.\nAll wasted because I didn’t ask the right question. Wish I had\nthose3months back! When you hear a request, it’s your job to understand the\nmotivations which led to it. You do that by digging around the\nquestion to find the root cause. Why do they bother doing it this\nway? Why do they want the feature? How are they currently coping withoutthefeature? Dig.  You should dig in the same way around emotional signals to\nunderstand where they’re coming from. Just like feature requests, any strong emotion is worth exploring. Is someone angry? Dig.\nEmbarrassed? Dig.Overjoyed? Dig!  I once overheard a founder interviewing someone at a cafe\ntable next to me. The founder mentioned a problem and the guy responded, “Yeah, that’s pretty much the worst part of my day.”\nThe founder jotted something down in his notebook, and then\nmoved on to the next question. What!? It’s the worst part of his day and you’re not going to figure out why? That’s insane. You’ve\ngotto dig.

 THE MOM TEST \nQuestions to dig into emotional signals:  “Tellmemoreabout that.”  “Thatseemstoreallybug you—Ibetthere’sa storyhere.” “Whatmakesit soawful?” “Whyhaven’tyoubeenabletofixthisalready?”  “Youseem prettyexcitedaboutthat—it’sabig deal?” “Why sohappy?” “Go on.” These nudges don’t need to be complicated. People love talking\nabout their opinions and emotions. Digging into a signal is basi‐\ncallyjustgiving them permissiontodoabrain dump. Rule of thumb: Ideas and feature requests should be understood, butnotobeyed. \nAVOIDING APPROVAL-SEEKING As we’ve seen, compliments are dangerous and sneaky. So if we\ncan nip them in the bud before they bloom, so much the better. The main source of compliment-creation is seeking approval,\neitherintentionallyorinadvertently.  Doing it intentionally is fishing for compliments. In other\nwords, you aren’t really looking for contradictory information.

You\nhave to apply The Mom Test to the questions which matter.\nOtherwise you’re just spinning yourwheels.  In addition to ensuring that you aren’t asking trivialities, you\nalso need to search out the world-rocking scary questions you’ve been unintentionally shrinking from. The best way to find them\nis with thought experiments. Imagine that the company has failed\nand ask why that happened. Then imagine it as a huge success\nand ask what had to be true to get there. Find ways to learn about\nthose critical pieces.  You can tell it’s an important question when its answer could completely change (or disprove) your business.

 ROB FITZPATRICK \none question which has the potential to destroy your currently\nimaginedbusiness.  One of my companies had some legal ambiguities around\ncontent ownership. We were okay in theory, but lacked strong precedents.

 THE MOM TEST work, that’s bad. If you hustle together $50k to start your business andspendall$50k onyour firstidea only to see it fail,that’sbad.  On the other hand, if you have $50k and spend $5k to learn\nyou’re running down a dead end, that’s awesome. You can use the rest to find a viable path to your goal, with the advantage of all\ntheextrathingsyou now know.  Similarly, if you have an exciting idea for a new product and\ngo talk to a couple customers who don’t actually care about it, then that’s a great result. You just saved yourself however much\ntimeand money itwould havecosttotry buildingand sellingit.  We go through the futile process of asking for opinions and fishing for compliments because we crave approval. We want to\nbelieve that the support and sign-off of someone we respect\nmeans our venture will succeed. But really, that person’s opinion\ndoesn’t matter. They have no idea if the business is going to work. Only themarket knows.  Learning that your beliefs are wrong is frustrating, but it’s\nprogress. It’s bringing you ever closer to the truth of a real problem and a good market. The worst thing you can do is ignore\nthe bad news while searching for some tiny grain of validation to\ncelebrate. Youwantthetruth, nota goldstar. Some of the most informative (and thus best) responses you\ncan get are along the lines of, “Umm, I’m not so sure about that”\nand “That's pretty neat.” Both are lukewarm responses which tell\nyouthey don’t care. In this context, “best” means learning, not selling. If you’re a\nsales guy going door to door selling gadgets and someone doesn’t\ncare, then that is a bad result: you’re not getting paid. But if you’re trying to decide whether to invest your time and money in\ndeveloping, building and promoting that gadget, then lukewarm\nis a terrific response.

ROB FITZPATRICK  The classic error in response to a lukewarm signal is to “up\nyour game” and pitch them until they say something nice. Unless\nthey’re holding a check, the only thing to gain from “convincing”\nthem are false positives. You’re not here to collect compliments; you’re trying to learn the truth. Their lukewarm response already\ngave youthat.  If they’re still engaged in the conversation, it’s worth asking a couple follow-up questions to understand the nature of their\napathy. Is the “problem” not actually that big of a deal? Are they\nfundamentally different from your ideal customers? Do they not care about the specific implementation? Are they worn out and\nskeptical from hearing too many pitches, like cafe owners in the\naftermath of Groupon? Are they just plaintiredtoday? After that, say a big thanks and leave them to their day.\nThey’ve probably helped you more than the guy who said he\nlovedit. Rule of thumb: There’s more reliable information in a “meh” than a “Wow!” Youcan’t build a business ona lukewarmresponse. \nLOOK BEFORE YOU ZOOM Another way to miss the important questions is by obsessing over\nultimately unimportant nuances. We let ourselves get stuck in\nthe details before understanding the bigpicture. Everyone has problems they know about, but don’t actually\ncare enough about to fix. And if you zoom in too quickly and lead\nthem to that semi-problem, they’ll happily drown you in all the unimportant details.

 THE MOM TEST A (really, really) bad conversation:  You: “Hi. Thanks for taking the time.

 ROB FITZPATRICK necessarily assume that they’re also going to happily pay for traffic.  For example, I have a blog which I quite like (but which I\ndon’t take seriously as a business). If you’re talking to me and you ask, “Hey Rob, what are your top problems with marketing your\nblog?” Then you’ve just prematurely zoomed in on a non-\nproblem.  I’m going to tell you some sort of answer which sounds legit but is actually misleading. I might say that my keywords are all\nkind of generic, so it’s hard to attract the right people. Or that I\nwalk a fine line between writing beginner and advanced articles, so choosing the right topics is always weird. Whatever. Problems\nexist with my blog marketing, but the whole space just isn’t some‐\nthing I’m too fussed about. I blog because it’s fun, not because it\npays myrent. To have a useful conversation, you need to zoom back out to\nask aboutmyblog in general, ratherthan marketing myblog.

ROB FITZPATRICK get some clarity by asking cost/value questions like the following. “Does-this-problem-matter” questions:  “Howseriouslydoyoutake yourblog?” “Doyoumakemoney from it?”  “Haveyoutriedmaking moremoneyfrom it?” “Howmuchtimedoyouspendonit eachweek?” “Doyouhaveanymajoraspirationsforyourblog?”  “Whichtoolsandservicesdoyouuse for it?” “Whatareyoualreadydoing toimprovethis?” “Whatarethe3big thingsyou’retrying to fixor  improverightnow?” Some of these questions are generic, but give us signals that\nwe can anchor on and dig around. The bulk of them are about finding out whether the person we’re talking to is taking this\nspace seriously. Are they spending money? Making money? Is the\nproblem intheirtop3? Aretheyactivelylooking for solutions? When you fall into a premature zoom, you can waste a ton of\ntime figuring out the minutia of a trivial problem.

THE MOM TEST \nGAZE UPON THE ELEPHANT Sometimes we comfort ourselves by asking questions which don’t actually de-risk the business or resolve those critical, big, scary,\nlurking questions.Weignoretheelephantin theroom.  Let’s say we suspect that teachers from the poorest schools\nare completely overloaded, and that our tools would save them time so they could better educate their students. We go talk to\nthem and confirm that yes, they are completely overloaded. We\nthen spend weeks with them, figuring out exactly what their dream tool would do. Unfortunately, we've missed the elephant,\nwhich is that the poorest schools may not have the budgets avail‐\nable to pay us what we need to sustain and grow a business. We're liable to spend a huge amount of time exploring a real and urgent\nproblem, only to hop into the deadpool due to our customer’s\nbudgeting issues. Startups tend to have multiple failure points (e.g. the prob‐\nlems of the teachers and the ability of the schools to pay us). If\nany of these conditions doesn't exist, we must overhaul our idea. It’s tempting to obsess over the most interesting of several failure\npoints and ignore the others. And then we miss important\nquestions. Beyond the risks of our customers and market, we also have\nchallenges with our own product. Overlooking product risks is\njust as deadly as overlooking the goals and constraints of our\ncustomers.

THE MOM TEST otherpeoplewhowouldlovetoaswell.” Thisisthe importantbit —is itgood? So what’s the result? Beyond being excited, we got some concrete data about how valuable this could be to him. Plus, he\ngave a verbal commitment to be one of our early users. It sure\nseemsgood.  But what did he actually tell us? He said that if we can get him more gigs, then he’ll pay a cut. Well, obviously. Who doesn’t\nwant free money? His needs are clear: he wants to make more\nmoney by speaking. If we can send him work, he’ll share some of itwithus.Thiswasneverreallyin doubt.  The phrase “if you could get me more gigs” is basically\nshifting the burden from the customer to your product. Even\nthough you’ve found a pain, your success is dependent on a bunch of other factors, such as your ability to grow a healthy\nsupply of paying gigs which are a good fit for him. Will you be\nabletodothat? Itremainsto beseen. This situation is easier to spot in the online advertising indus‐\ntry. Imagine running customer conversations with an advertiser\nto try to understand their pains so you can convince them to advertise on your site. They’d sort of look at you blankly and say,\n“Listen, if you can get enough page views, we’ll pay you for\nthem.” In fact, it’s such a well established would-pay-to-solve-\nproblem that you don’t even need to talk to them to set it up. You justplug inanadnetworkandyou’redone.  Same deal with affiliate commissions. If you sell a company’s\nproducts, you get a cut. That’s just how it works.

 ROB FITZPATRICK Productrisk—CanIbuildit? CanI growit? Customer/marketrisk—Dotheywantit? Willthey  payme? Aretherelots ofthem?  You can’t overlook either one. I remember talking to a\nfounder who had wasted 3 months on worthless customer conver‐\nsations. He wanted to start a company building gadgets that\ntracked the fertility of farm animals, ultimately boosting birthrates and thus farm revenue. When he talked to farmers, he\nasked questions like, “Would you switch trackers if something\ncheaper and more effective was available?” That’s the same as asking someone whether they would like more money. The\nfarmers responded along the lines of, “If you can build what you\nsay you can build, I’ll equip my whole herd.” The problem is, he\ncouldn’tbuildit.Theriskwasintheproduct. I’ve also seen this strike several of the recent companies who\nwant to use mobile/realtime deals to drive foot traffic to bars and\nclubs. They run customer conversations with bar owners who confirm that: yes, they would like more customers on the slow\nnights; and yes, they would pay you if you could send customers\non demand. The founders take this as strong validation (“They have the problem and committed to pay!”) without recognising\nthat the vast majority of the risk is in the product, not the market.\nBars will pay, but only if you can amass a huge audience of\nconsumers. Then the founders talk to consumers and ask if they would use an app which always pointed them to booming parties\nwith cheap booze. Again, obviously yes. But that doesn’t tell us\nwhetherwecanactuallyachievethatcriticalmassof users. Video games are pure product risk. What sort of question\ncould you ask to validate your game idea? “Do you like having\nfun?

THE MOM TEST \nto make them notice it, they’ll buy it. You don’t need to rediscover\npeople’sdesiretoplayvideo games.  This isn’t to say that you shouldn’t talk to anyone if you’re\nbuilding something with product risk. In the case of the farm fertility monitor, it’s good to know that the farmer isn’t opposed\nto switching tech, for example. For the nightclubs, it’s good to\nknow that they’re at least theoretically willing to pay for promotion. It would be tragic to succeed at the hard work of\ncreating the product or community only to learn nobody will\npay for it. What all this does mean is that if you’ve got heavy product\nrisk (as opposed to pure market risk), then you’re not going to be\nable to prove as much of your business through conversations alone. The conversations give you a starting point, but you’ll have\nto start building product earlier and with less certainty than if\nyouhadpuremarketrisk.

Pre-planning your big questions makes it a lot easier to ask\nquestions which pass The Mom Test and aren’t biasing. It also\nmakes it easier to face the questions that hurt. When we go\nthrough an unplanned conversation, we tend to focus on trivial stuff that keeps the conversation comfortable. Instead, decide on\nthetoughquestionsinacalm environmentwith your team.  Your 3 questions will be different for each type of person you’re talking to. If you have multiple types of customers or part‐\nners,havealist foreach.

 ROB FITZPATRICK \nmurkiest or most important right now. Answer those will give you\nfirmerfooting andabettersenseofdirectionforyournext 3.  You might get answers 1-3 from customer A, answer 4 from\ncustomer B, answers 5-7 from customer C. There’s overlap and repetition, but you don’t need to repeat the full set of questions\nwith every participant. Your time is valuable; don’t feel obliged to\nrepeat questions you already have solid data on. Pick up where youleftoffandkeep filling inthe picture.  Knowing your list allows you to take better advantage of\nserendipitous encounters. Instead of running into that dream customer and asking to exchange business cards so you can “grab\na coffee” (exactly like everyone else), you can just pop off your\nmost important question.

 CHAPTER 4  KEEPING IT CASUAL y now, we know that zooming prematurely and introducing\nB  your idea too early creates biases and delivers bad data. In Steve Blank’s original book on Customer Development, 4 Steps to\nthe E.piphany, he solves this by recommending 3 separate meet‐\nings: the first about the customer and their problem; the second\nabout your solution; and the third to sell a product. By splitting\nthemeetings, you avoid the premature zoomandPathosProblem.  In practice, however, I’ve found it both difficult and ineffi‐ cient to set up all 3 meetings. The time cost of a 1-hour meeting is\nmore like 4 hours once you factor in the calendar dance, commut‐\ning, and reviewing. And it’s a big time commitment to ask from\nthe customer before you’re in a position to show them anything in\nreturn.  In the early days, asking for the initial problem conversation was simply impossible for me. I wasn’t credible enough, so\nnobody wanted to take a meeting just to talk to me about their\nday. Steve recommends starting with friendly first contacts. Defi‐\nnitely do that if you have them.

 ROB FITZPATRICK In my case though, I was entering a new industry with high walls (brandadvertising)and had nofriendlyfirst contacts.  As my credibility built after a couple years in the industry, I\nfound myself able to get meetings without any real “reason”. The 3-meeting structure was finally viable! But once I started doing it,\nit felt like a bad use of my time. The most precious resource in a\nstartup is its founders’ time. You have to put yourself where you\nmatter most, and I wasn’t finding early customer meetings to be that place. I wished I could get the learning without all the\noverhead.  If the solution isn’t a 3-meeting series, then what is it? You may have noticed a trend throughout the conversation examples\nwe’veseensofar:keeping it casual.  Let’s say I’m trying to build tools to help public speakers get\nmore speaking gigs and I bump into one at a conference. I’m not going to try to set up a meeting. Instead, I’m just going to immedi‐\nately transition into my most important question: “Hey, I’m\ncurious—how did you end up getting this gig?” As a side bonus, we’re also now having an interesting conversation and I’m far\nmorelikelytobe rememberedand geta meeting later.  When you strip all the formality from the process, you end up with no meetings, no “interviews”, and a much easier time all\naround. The conversations become so fast and lightweight that\nyou can go to a industry meetup and leave with a dozen customer\nconversations under your belt, each of which provided as much valueasalengthyformalmeeting.  The structure of separate problem/solution/sales conversa‐\ntions is critical for avoiding bias, but it’s important to realise that the first one doesn’t actually need to be a meeting.

THE MOM TEST \nworks better as a quick and casual chat than a long, formal\nmeeting. \nTHE MEETING ANTI-PATTERN The Meeting Anti-Pattern is the tendency to relegate every\nopportunity forcustomerconversationinto a calendarblock. Beyond being a bad use of your time and setting expectations\nthat you’re going to show them a product, over-reliance on formal\nmeetings leads us to overlook perfectly good chances for serendipitous learning.  Imagine that you’re in a crowded cafe, tapping away at your\nkeyboard, when your dream boy/girl sits down next to you. They’re wearing a charming hat and give you a friendly nod\nbefore cracking open a dog-eared old novel which just totally\ncompletes the mood. You slam down a quick espresso to psych yourself up and fumble through some sort of awkward mono‐\nlogue about how they seem like a really nice person and this is\nkind of weird because you don’t even know each other but maybe they want to go get a coffee sometime? Like, a different coffee? At\nadifferent place?  It’s obvious that this is a silly situation. After all, the purpose of a date is to talk to each other and see if you get along. There‐\nfore, for all intents and purposes, you were already on one. And\nthen you messed it up by trying to over-formalise it when you\ncould have just chatted a bit and skipped that whole first date completely.  We’re going to pull exactly the same trick on our early\ncustomer conversations. We’re going to strip the pomp and circumstance and reduce it from a meeting to a chat.

 ROB FITZPATRICK Friday, figured out the big questions over the weekend, and then went to an industry event on Monday. A handful of office\nmanagers were there and without any of them realising we’d\n“had a meeting”, I'd learned that the big problem was really about debt collection rather than efficiency. I got there by just\nbeing interested and chatting with them over a beer: “X seems\nreally annoying, how do you deal with it?” “Is Y as bad as it\nseems?” “You guys did a great job with Z… Where did you get that from?”  Being too formal is a crutch we use to deal with an admittedly\nambiguous and awkward situation. Instead of leaving wiggle room for the unexpected, everything becomes a process. But\nthere’s a big time cost to formality, and it tends to clobber much of\nthe learning we hoped toachieve. Symptoms of formality:  “So,first off, thanks for agreeing to this interview. I  just have a few questions for youand thenI’ll let you  get back toyourday…” “Ona scale of 1 to 5, how much would yousayyou…” Learning from customers doesn’t mean you have to be\nwearing a suit and sipping ominous boardroom coffee. Asking the right questions is fast and touches on topics that people find quite\ninteresting. You can talk anywhere and save yourself the formal\nmeetings until youhave something concretetoshow. At their best, these conversations are a pleasure for both\nparties.

 THE MOM TEST \nRule of thumb: If it feels like they’re doing you a favour by talking\nto you, it’s probably tooformal. \nHOW LONG ARE MEETINGS? Early conversations are very fast. The chats grow longer as you\nmove from the early broad questions (“Is this a real problem?”) toward more specific product and industry issues (“Which other\nsoftware do we have to integrate with to closethesale?”)  For example, it only takes 5 minutes (maximum) to learn whether a problem exists and isimportant.  A bit further along, you’ll find yourself asking questions\nwhich are answered with long stories explaining their workflow, how they spend their time, and what else they’ve tried. You can\nusually get what you came for in 10-15 minutes, but people love\ntelling stories about themselves, so you can keep this conversation going indefinitely if it’s valuable for youand funforthem.  At the extreme end, learning the details of an industry takes\nan hour or more. Thankfully, those are easier conversations to facilitate since the other person (usually some sort of industry\nexpert) can go into a monologue once you point them in the right\ndirection. The duration of formal B2B meetings (the kind you schedule)\nis determined more by the arbitrary calendar block than by what\nyou actually want to learn. Of course, you've liable to burn 15\nminutes just to getting a cup of tea and saying hello before the meeting actually starts. But sometimes the tea is fancy, so that’s\nnice.  Once you have a product and the meetings take on a more sales-oriented feel, you’ll want to start carving out clear blocks of\n30ish minutes.

 ROB FITZPATRICK \nshow/describe the product, and the last 5 minutes figuring out\nnextstepsandadvancement. That'syour half hour.  The potential speed of the early conversations is one of the\nbig reasons I like keeping it casual and skipping the meeting. Scheduling and going to a meeting is too much overhead for a\nchat which only needs to be 10 minutes long. Even explaining\nthat you’re starting a company and would love to ask a couple questions can take 5 or 10 minutes. You'll make progress a lot\nfaster if you’re able to leave your idea out of it for as long as\npossible.

I once had a product idea to help busy investors to manage their dealflow. I knew they got hundreds of applications per\nmonth and figured it must be a spreadsheet nightmare.

Each held a name and a phone number. “Our analysts kill\nmost of them before they ever reach us, and then we trash a bunch more. We only end up with a few that are serious\ncontenders. Then we just call every couple weeks to see how it’s\ngoing.” I said it didn’t sound so bad and he agreed that it works pretty well.

THE MOM TEST \nguy even realised we were talking about it. It took 5 minutes,\navoided biases, and didn’t feed us any bad data in the form of\ncompliments, fluff, or ideas. Instead, we got concrete facts about\nour customers which directly answer our most important questions.  Of course, it took a 2-hour commute to get to those 5 minutes.\nItcan’tbe perfecteverytime. Sometimes, as happened above, we prove ourselves wrong.\nOther times, everything we hear just makes us even more excited.\nIn that case, we can stand atop all that we’ve learned and take the visionary leap of coming up with a specific offering to make our\ncustomers’livesbetter.

CHAPTER 5  COMMITMENT AND  ADVANCEMENT  nce we've learned the key facts about our industry and\nO  customers, it’s time to zoom in again and start revealing our idea and showing some product. The bad news is that this\ninvites nefarious compliments. The good news is that since we\nhave the beginnings of a product, we’re now in a position to cut\nthrough the false positives by asking forcommitments.  In sales, moving the relationship to the next stage is called\n“advancement”. It’s like pushing a customer into the next step of your real-world acquisition funnel. They’ll either move forward\nor make it clear that they’re not a customer. Both are good results\nforyourlearning.  When you fail to push for advancement, you end up with\nzombie leads: potential customers (or investors) who keep taking\nmeetings and saying nice things, but who never seem to cut a check.It’slike your startup has been friend-zoned.

THE MOM TEST \nRule of thumb: “Customers” who keep being friendly but aren’t\never going to buy are a particularly dangerous source of mixed\nsignals. \nMEETINGS EITHER SUCCEED OR FAIL It took me years to learn that there’s no such thing as a meeting which just “went well”. Every meeting either succeeds or fails.\nYou’ve lost the meeting when you leave with a compliment or a\nstalling tactic. While we might spot something as blatant as “Let’s talk again after the holidays... Don’t call me, I’ll call you,” we\nacceptthemoresubtleversions every day.  A meeting has succeeded when it ends with a commitment to advance to the next step. But you have to force this resolution or\nthe meetings drift along in la-la-land while performing their\nancientduty: wasting everyone’stime. If you leave with worthless wishy washiness, I’d bet you’re\nfalling forone(orboth)of thefollowing traps: 1. You’reasking fortheiropinionabout your idea (e.g.  fishing forcompliments) 2. You’renotasking fora clearcommitment or next steps You know how to deal with compliments by now: deflect,\nignore, and get back to business. Commitments are similarly easy to master, once we know what we’re trying to do. When we leave\nwithout a commitment, sometimes it’s because we asked and got\nrejected. That’s sad, but it happens. Not everyone is going to convert and at least you now know where you stand. You have a\nstrong negativedata point. That’sgood learning!  The real failure is listed above as #2: not even asking. I never consider rejection to be a real failure.

 ROB FITZPATRICK \nThis can happen because you’re avoiding the scary question or\nbecause youhaven’tfigured out what the next stepsshouldbe.  Commitment is important. It shows us whether people actu‐\nally care about what we’re doing. The more they give up, the more we cantrustthem. Rule of thumb: If you don’t know what happens next after a\nproduct or sales meeting, the meeting waspointless. \nTHE CURRENCIES OF CONVERSATION Commitment can be cash, but doesn’t have to be. Think of it in terms of currency—what are they giving up for you? A compli‐\nment costs them nothing, so it’s worth nothing and carries no\ndata. The major currencies are time, reputationrisk,and cash.

 ROB FITZPATRICK “I woulddefinitely buythat.” “When can we startthe trial?”  “Can I buytheprototype?”  “When can youcome back totalk tothe restof the team?” \n\"That's so cool. I love it!\"  Bad meeting. Pure, unadulterated compliment. This may\nmake you feel good, but there is precisely zero data here. On the bright side, at least you won’t hurt yourself on this one since it’s so\nobviouslyfluff.  Tofix it, deflectthe complimentandgetback to business. \"Looks great. Let me know when it launches.\"  Bad meeting. A compliment plus a stalling tactic is the classic way to end a pitch for something you’re never going to buy. This\ncomes in a lot of flavours, but they’re all basically a polite way to\nsay, “Don’tcallme, I’ll call you.” The big error you can make here is to mistake this compli‐\nment-stall for a pre-order (“He said he’ll buy it when it launch‐\nes!”). Tofix it, look foracommitmentyoucan ask fortoday.  If you are very early stage, you might ask for an introduction to his boss or tech team or the budget-holder so you can “make\nsure you fully understand their needs.” The point is just to find\nsomething to ask for that they are going to think twice about givingyou.

THE MOM TEST \n\"There are a couple people I can introduce you to\nwhen you're ready.\" Nearly a good meeting, but right now it’s bad. There’s some\ndata here, but probably not as much as you initially hope. At least\nyou know he doesn’t think you’re completely nuts or he wouldn’t have even made the fluffy offer (unless he’s just name dropping).\nThe problem is that the promise is so generic that it’s a worthless\nsignal.  To fix it, try to convert fuzzy promises into something more concrete. The more specific it is, the more seriously you can\ntake it. For example: who does he want to introduce you to and\nwhat does “ready” mean? And why can’t he make the intro now? This isn’t about being pushy. You don’t have manifest\ndestiny over his rolodex. But you do need to distinguish\nbetween legitimate offers and polite gesturing. Knowing what\n“ready” means can also give you a better sense of your short-term goals. \"What are the next steps?\"  Good meeting (usually). A classic good meeting conclusion.\nTo succeed, a meeting doesn’t need to end with a check in your pocket. Itjustneedstoadvance tothe nextstep, whateverthat is.  It's worth noting that you need to know your next steps to\nbenefit from this. If you have to say, “Let me have a think about\nthat and get back to you,” then you’ve ruined a perfectly good meeting.  Of course, even clear next steps can be a lie. Everything can\nbe a lie. But with next steps in your pocket, you've got a fighting chance.

ROB FITZPATRICK Although they may be sincere, it won’t hurt to remain skeptical untilthe exchange of value actually happens. \"I would deﬁnitely buy that.\"  Bad meeting. Danger! There’s admittedly some signal here,\nbut the danger from false positives is off the charts. This is the\nmisinterpreted “data” which sunk the first startup I worked at to the tune of ten million bucks.  To fix it, you need to shift from fuzzy future promises into\nconcrete current commitments. For example, you could ask for a letter of intent, a pre-purchase, a deposit, or intros to other deci‐\nsion makers and team members. The reason Kickstarter is so\nwonderful is because it forces customers who say they would buy ittoactuallypulloutacreditcardand commit. \n\"When can we start the trial?\" Maybe a good meeting. Unlike “When does it launch,” which\nis usually a stall, “When can we start” tends to be a step forward.\nSetting up new software and training staff is a big deal for most businesses. Even a “free” trial can cost them serious money.\nHowever, in some cases, “trying” software costs nothing, espe‐\ncially for individuals. For example, I've “tried” countless CRM\n(contact management) apps. It takes me ten seconds to log in, look around, andneverthink aboutitagain. Notahuge commitment.  As always, think in terms of currency. What are they giving\nup to try it out? If your trial is too “cheap”, you can try to increase its cost. For example, you could ask to write a case study about\nthem after they’ve spent 2 weeks using it. Or you could get them\nto promise to try using it with their team for at least a week.

THE MOM TEST \nThe more they are giving up for you, the more seriously you can\ntake theirvalidation. \"Can I buy the prototype?\"  Great meeting. The best meeting conclusion I've seen is the\nrarely-heardbutalwaysappreciated, “Can I buythe prototype?” A product designer was once showing me a brilliant smart‐\nphone tripod and mount he was designing. He demoed the 3D-\nprinted prototype unit for me and I immediately asked him how much it would cost to buy it. He laughed and said he’d gone\nthrough a dozen prototypes already because people kept buying\nthem. That’sa good sign. \"When can you come back to talk to the rest of the team?\"  Good meeting. Bingo! If you are selling anything to compa‐\nnies, you’re going to have to talk to multiple people. If they won’t introduce you, then it’sasafe betyou’re ata deadend.  Enterprise salesistedious, butone of the perksisthatyoucan\nget really accurate signals like this one quite early in the process. Building consumer products is a lot murkier since the customer\nconversation process doesn’t mimic the purchase process\nas much. \nHOW TO FIX A BAD MEETING \nThe worst meetings are the wishy-washy ones that you leave with\nneither rejection nor advancement.

 ROB FITZPATRICK trying to solve their problem, those cold conversations start turning intowarmintros. Thesnowballis rolling. Cold calls  What does it mean if you reach out to 100 people and 98 of\nthem hang up on you? Well, nothing, except that people don’t\nlike getting cold calls. No surprise there. More importantly, it means you’ve now got 2 conversations in play. Unless your plan is\ntosellyourappviacoldcalls, therejectionrateis irrelevant.  I know one team who successfully used cold LinkedIn messages to reach C-level execs of several major UK retailers.\nThey were ignored by practically every exec in the country, but\nyouonlyneedone “yes”togetyou started. Beyond hard hustle, stay open to serendipity. There are lots\nof waystogetlucky whenyou’reinthemood forit. Seizing serendipity  While I was considering building tools for professional speak‐\ners, I found myself at a friend-of-a-friend’s engagement party. I heard someone across the room say “…my talk in Tokyo next\nweek” and made a beeline over to her. She left the party thinking\nI was a nice guy who was super interested in her career and I left\nwith a bunch of useful customer insight. She ended up becoming my firstcommitted alpha user.  If it sounds weird to unexpectedly interview people, then\nthat’s only because you’re thinking of them as interviews instead of conversations.

 THE MOM TEST Rule of thumb: If it’s not a formal meeting, you don’t need to make excuses about why you’re there or even mention that you’re\nstarting abusiness. Justask about their life. Find a good excuse  I was chatting to an aspiring entrepreneur in a cafe. Among\nother things, his product could help cafe owners educate poten‐ tial customers on the origins and backstory of the coffee beans.\nHe had been hitting the pavement for the past 2 weeks and\ngetting turned away from cafe after cafe. He wanted to talk to me about his customer interview process. Ten minutes into the\nconversation, I cut in: “Who have you talked to so far?” “Nobody\nwill take time to talk to me; they all just say to come back later.” I flagged down the waitress who was walking by. “Excuse me, can I\nspeak to the owner?” “Umm.” “Don’t worry, it’s nothing bad.\nThis coffee is amazing and I wanted to ask him about the story\nbehind the beans.” The owner wasn't around, but with a good excuse in hand, we were soon chatting with the manager. And\nthe manager, in turn, gave us the owner’s contact details and said\nhe’dbeinon Tuesday. The practical downside is that no matter how well the chat\ngoes, it’s impossible to transition into a product or sales conversa‐\ntion, since doing so reveals your initial deception and destroys\ntrust. When I open with an excuse, I tend to consider the chat to be a throwaway for one-time learning instead of an ongoing rela‐\ntionship.  You’ve got the ultimate excuse if you have a PhD student on your founding team. “Hello, I’m doing my PhD research on the\nproblems around X, it would be a huge help if I could ask you a\ncouple

 THE MOM TEST \nqualified leads for you to reach out to and strike up a conversation\nwith.  Paul Graham suggests that generic launch can be a solid start\nfor the same reason. Get your product out there, see who seems to like it most, and then reach out to those types of users for deeper\nlearning.  This is starting to bring the customers to you instead of going to them, but still involves sending a mostly cold email. Next, we’ll\nlook at how to run with this principle to make our lives even\neasier. BRINGING THEM TO YOU When you are finding ways to sneak into customer conversations,\nyou’re always on the back foot. You made the approach, so they\nare suspicious and trying to figure out if you’re wasting their time. Instead, we should look for ways to separate ourselves from the\ncrowd so they can find us. Beyond saving vast sums of time and\nfrustration, bringing people to you also makes them take you more seriously and want to help you more. How can you plant a\nflag your customers can see? What can you offer them that will\nmake them want to talktoyou? Organise meetups For marginally more effort than attending an event, you can\norganise your ownand benefit from being the centre ofattention.  Want to figure out the problems HR professionals have?\nOrganise an event called “HR professionals happy hour”.

 ROB FITZPATRICK neurs, so I just stood on a chair and yelled, “Excuse me, does anyone here know anyone who works at McKinsey? Can we talk\nto you for a second? We’ll buy you a beer!” The founders bought\nthree beers, hadthree quick chats, andleftwith adiaryof intros. This is even easier for consumer products.

Rule of thumb: Kevin Bacon’s 7 degrees of separation applies to\ncustomer conversations. You can find anyone you need if you ask foritacouple times. Industry advisors  I relied heavily on advisors in my first company. We didn’t\nknow the industry and nobody took us seriously. Our 5 advisors\neach had around a half percent of equity and basically just made credible intros. I met with each once per month, so I’d get a fresh\nbatch of intros weekly without it being a huge time burden for\nanyof them.

 ROB FITZPATRICK \nnext steps and commitments that you can ask for if the meeting\ngoes well.  It’s worth noting that this is how I set up meetings from warm\nintros. Warm intros mean the person wants to give you the benefit of the doubt, but is still terrified you’re going to waste\ntheir time with a vague, chit-chatty meeting. The goal with this\nthe VFWPA structure is to specify exactly what I need and how they, in particular can help.

When someone is having a coffee with you,\nthere’s the potential to chat as friends. You can just shoot the\nbreeze about the industry for a bit. You can keep it casual. They’reenjoying theconversation.  The same is decidedly not true on the phone or Skype.\nPeople try to squeeze calls in between other activities, wondering how quickly they can “finish with business” and hang up.

 THE MOM TEST \non the phone are super annoyed when you “just want to chat”. So\nyou need to make the whole thing more formal, which is one of\ntheexactmistakeswe’retrying to avoid!  Phone calls end up sounding more like scripted interviews than natural conversations, because they are. It’s a constraint of\nthemedium.  Plus, nobody becomes friends over the phone, which means you aren’t going to get the warm intros and future meetings you\nneed. Setting up a call feels faster in the short-term, but that’s\nbecause you aren’t yet able to see all the time-saving and busi‐ ness-saving benefits of in-person relationships with your\ncustomers.  That being said, some other great people in the field like and recommend phone calls. Use whatever works. But I will say that\nyou should start in person. It’s too easy to use surveys or phone\ncalls as an excuse to skip the awkwardness of meeting in person ratherthanasaconsideredtrade-off. \nTHE ADVISORY FLIP In terms of mindset, don’t go into these discussions looking for\ncustomers. It creates a needy vibe and forfeits the position of power. Instead, go in search of industry and customer advisors.\nYou are just trying to find helpful, knowledgable people who are\nexcitedabout youridea.  With that mindset switch, you’ll know why you’re there. And instead of it being a customer-learning-but-I-really-want-to-do-\nsales meeting, it becomes a let-me-find-out-if-you-are-a-good-advi‐\nsor-by-asking-questions meeting. Willpower is a finite resource. The way to overcome difficult\nsituations isn’t to power through, but rather to change your\ncircumstances to require less willpower.

In fact, I wouldn’t unless you already quite like them and it happens to come up in conversation.

 ROB FITZPATRICK up talking to a multiple customer segments all at once, which leadstoconfusing signalsandthree problems:  1. Yougetoverwhelmedby optionsand don’tknow where to start 2. Youaren’t moving forwardbutcan’tproveyourself  wrong 3. Youreceivemixed feedback and can’tmakesense of it \nBabies or body builders?  I talked to a woman who had developed a very cool powdered condiment. It was sweet (like a cinnamon brown sugar), but had\nall the nutrition of a multivitamin. In fact, it was an all-natural\nsuperfood: you survive indefinitely eating nothing but that\npowder. She said it had countless uses: you could sprinkle it on your\nbreakfast or mix it in with your protein shake. Moms could trick\ntheir kids into being healthy. Restaurants could leave it on the tables as a healthy sugar alternative. However, she was running in\ncircles because the bodybuilders wanted one thing, the restau‐\nrants wanted another, and the moms needed a third. Making one\nof them happy always disappointed the others. She didn’t know how to start. Even simple problems like which colour to use for\nthelabelwere impossibleto answer.  Before we can serve everyone, we have to serve someone. Forgetting about all the possibilities and focusing on who would\nmost likely buy, she decided it was moms with young kids who\nare currently shopping at health food stores.

 THE MOM TEST She found a way to kill two birds with one stone by going into only the small, independent health food stores and asking them to\nplace a few bottles of her condiment beside the breakfast foods.\nIt’s a great commitment to ask for (some shelf space) that would help distinguish between kind words and serious retailers. She\nwould return in a week to ask them about their experiences. If the\nstores were happy and the product sold, she could begin finding\nways to talk to their customers (and her end consumers), perhaps viaanin-storetasting.  This journey sounds obvious when we look at it as a case\nstudy. But when we’re in the moment, choosing a really specific customer segment just feels like we’re losing all the other options.\nAnd that loss is painful. Remind yourself that you’ll get to the\nwhole world eventually. But you’ve got to start somewhere\nspecific. Big brands or mom & pop? I was once thrilled that my customer segment was “advertis‐\ners”. Everyone advertises somehow, so naturally this was very\nexciting. Our market was practically infinite! I talked to mom- and-pop shops, e-tailers, big brands, creative agencies, SMEs,\nmusic labels and more. Everyone I talked to had different needs,\nconstraints, problems, and desires.  Everything we tried ended up sort of working. Everything was somewhat promising. Some people were talking about paying\nus $10,000/month while others scoffed at the idea of paying $10.\nEvery new feature was moderately popular. But if we tried to cut any of those middling features, we would get an uproar. It was\nalwayssomeone’sfavourite part.  In reality, our customer segment was just too broad.

 ROB FITZPATRICK ing, “Well, those guys would love it.” The reverse argument could be made to prevent any feature’sremoval.  The big trouble was that we could prove ourselves neither\nright nor wrong. We could never say that a new idea had really worked or totally failed. We were paying attention to so many\ncustomer segments that there was pretty much always someone it\nworked for. But making a so-so product for a bunch of audiences\nisn’t quite the same as making anincredible productforone.

 THE MOM TEST dents”. I’ve got a picture of an American undergraduate in my head, and maybe you picture a British grad student, but we\nmanage to agree onfeatures and startbuilding.  Once we launch, the feedback starts coming in. But it’s not what we expect. One user needs to add formal citations. Another\nwants practice questions. A third needs it to run on the iPad. A\nfourth needs eighty collaborators who can share the same\ncomputer. The next needs to use the app through an intermittent internet connection. We’re looking at this list of requirements\nand our soul feels like it’s being forced through a colander. This\nwill literally take us years to build. Where dowe start? It turns out that “students” is a broader segment than we\ninitially expected. The first is a PhD student. The second is an\nambitious youngling at a prep school. The third is a home‐\nschooling parent who wants to use it with her kid. The fourth is a rural village in the Indian rice belt where the local kids are self-\neducating through the one shared computer. The fifth is in\nAfrica, running the app off a shaky cellphone connection. All are “students”.  The confused founders we met at the beginning of this\nsection were having the same experience, but for “sales organisa‐ tions” instead of “students”. There are countless kinds of sales\norganisations with fundamentally different needs, workflows,\ntools and goals. But from the outside, they all look like companies\nwho do sales. Even if you narrow it down with a demographic constraint, as these guys did (sales organisations with 25-250\nsalespeople), you’re still facing impossible amounts ofvariation.  These guys weren’t having 20 conversations with their customers. They were having one conversation each with 20\ndifferent types of customers. That’s why the feedback was so\ninconsistent.

THE MOM TEST demographic groups and the second is a set of goals/motivations. Some will still be fairly generic. Go back through the generic\nones and keep slicing. Just repeat the questions above. Within\nthatsub-group, whowantsitmost? Repeat, repeat. As a quick example, say I’m building some sort of high-end\nfitness gadget for busy professionals. It’s going to be expensive, so\nI figure they have to be high-income (finance professionals?), and\nit’s going to be digital, so I imagine they’ll be young (25-35?). And finance professionalslive in big cities, sowe’lltack that on.  So my customer segment is “finance professionals, age 25-35,\nliving in a major city”, right? No! This is a totally worthless segment because it doesn’t help me make better decisions and\ndoesn’thelpme findthem.  On the other hand, if I slice it down further to the sub-group\nwho wants it most, then I can get somewhere. We could slice that initial segment into something like: finance professionals in\nLondon currently training for a marathon. Better! We know this\nslice is taking fitness seriously, so we might suspect they’re stronger early adopters. We could slice that even further by\nsaying that we want the sub-sub-subset who go to the gym during\ntheir lunch hour. Now we can have all the customer conversa‐ tions we desire for the price of a membership to a gym in\nLondon’s financial district.  If there isn’t a clear physical or digital location at which you\ncan find your customer segment, then it’s probably still too broad. Go back up the list and slice it into finer pieces until you know\nwhere to find them. A customer segment isn’t very useful if\nthere’snowayyoucan getin touch.

 ROB FITZPATRICK 3. Personally rewarding Don’t plan and theorise forever about this stuff. Just spend a\nfew minutes to reach to a concrete initial segment so you can go findafew of them andmove the businessforward.  As we mentioned, you’ll broaden your segment back out\nlater. But your learning will go faster (and be more useful) for now by choosing someone who is specific and who also and meets\nthe three big criteria of being reachable, profitable, and personally\nrewarding.

 THE MOM TEST buying processandhave overlookedsome of the stakeholders We’ve already talked about #1. If you talk to everyone, many of them are inevitablygoing to bewrong.  Regarding #2 and 3, you can miss segments and overlook\nbuyers in lots of ways. The first important step is to know they\nexist. Sometimes it’s obvious. If you are a multi-sided market‐ place, youclearlyhave multiple customer segments.  Other times it’s sneakier. If you’re building an app for kids,\nyou need to understand and sell to both them and their parents. If you’re building something for public schools, you need to\nunderstand the teachers, the students, the administration, and\npotentially even the parent-teacher association and the tax\npayers. You’ll also need to worry about multiple groups if you rely on\nan important partner, whether for manufacturing, distribution, or\npromotion. If your business relies on them, you’d better under‐ stand their goals and constraints just as well as you understand\nthose of your customers.  Don’t fall into the trap of only talking to the most senior or important people you can find. You want to talk to people who\nare representative of your customers, not the ones who sound\nimpressive on your status report. When I was building interactive\nadvertising products, I spent lots of time talking to executives and none talking tothe kidswhowere supposedtolove our products.  A common question is whether you need to run customer\nconversations separately for all the various segments in a multi- sided marketplace. Yes, you do.

A common anti-pattern is for the business guy to go to all the\nmeetings and subsequently tell the rest of the team what they\nshould do. Bad idea.

ROB FITZPATRICK \nteam promptly and faithfully, which depends on good notes plus\nabitof pre-andpost-meeting work.  The most extreme way to bottleneck is to go to the meetings\nalone and take crappy notes which you don’t review with your team. At that point, your head has become the ultimate reposi‐\ntoryof customertruthandeveryonejusthastodowhat you say.  In my case, I once bottlenecked so hard that our CTO quit while saying, “We’re never going to succeed if you keep changing\nwhat we’re doing.” In my defence, the stuff I’d learned was true\n(at least, I think it was). But it didn’t matter anyway since I hadn’t properlycommunicated ittotherestof the team.  Learning bottlenecks can be created from either end: the\nfounderintouchwithcustomerscandoabadjobofsharingit,orthe productteamcanrefusetoengagewithcustomersandwhattheysay. Symptoms of a learning bottleneck:  “Youjustworry abouttheproduct. I’llhandlethe  customers.” “Because thecustomerstold meso!” “Idon’thavetimetotalk topeople—Ineedtobe  coding!” Avoiding bottlenecks has three parts: prepping, reviewing,\nandtaking goodnotes.

THE MOM TEST If you’ve already learned the facts of your customer and industry, then you should also know what commitment and next\nstepsyouaregoing topushforattheend of the meeting.  It’s easier to guide the conversation and stay on track if you have an existing set of beliefs that you’re updating. Spend up to\nan hour writing down your best guesses about what the person\nyou’re about to talk to cares about and wants.

And that could actually be the case if you’ve beendoing them wrong.

These aren’t long, involved strategy discussions. Your gut\nreaction is enough. You don’t need to be so rigorous. A little prep goes a long way, but you do need a little.

THE MOM TEST \nallows your whole team to benefit from the learning you’ve\nworked so hard toacquire.  On a logistical level, some teams have a quick chat about the\nresults of each meeting as soon as they get back to the office. Others have longer weekly meetings to go through all the week’s\nnotes and learnings. To deal with working remotely at Founder‐\nCentric, we keep a chat window open exclusively for sharing our customer learnings whenever wefinish ameeting. \nWHO SHOULD SHOW UP Everyone on the team who is making big decisions (including\ntech decisions) needs to be involved in at least the occasional customer conversation.

The main problem of running solo is that it’s harder to\ncatch yourself when you start going off-track by pitching, asking\nbad questions, or missingthe point. If you’re shy and have no cofounder to take the lead, call in a\nfavour with a friend to come to your first couple conversations\nwith you.

ROB FITZPATRICK \nbullet, remember that confidence is domain-specific and that it\nwill stop being so awkward as you do it more. Focus on under‐\nstanding the processandgetting better.  You can't outsource or hire someone to do customer learning. There are exceptional team dynamics where it works, but gener‐\nally speaking, the founders need to be in the meetings them‐\nselves. When a hired gun brings you bad news (“The problem isn’trealandnobodycares”), properlyassimilatingitis difficult.  More insidiously, if the signal is lukewarm, it’s tempting for a\nhire to gloss over it. Hiring out your learning is a guaranteed way to get bad signals. Until you’ve got a working business model and\na repeatable sales or marketing process, the founders need to be\nin the meetingsthemselves. On the bright side, even though you have to be in the room to\nprocess the learning, you don’t necessarily have to be the one\nsetting up or leading the meetings. You can hire people to help as longasyou’re there with them, listening. \nHOW TO WRITE IT DOWN Taking good notes is the best way to keep your team (and\ninvestors and advisors) in the loop. Plus, notes make it harder to lie to yourself. And when, months later, you decide to adjust the\nbusiness’s direction, you’ll be able to return to your notes instead\nof having togodoawhole new setofinterviews.  When possible, write down exact quotes. Wrap them in quotation marks so you know it’s verbatim. You can later use\nthem in your marketing language, fundraising decks, and to\nresolve arguments with skeptical teammates. Other times the detailsaren’tsorelevantandyoucan justjotdown the gist.  In either case, add symbols to your notes as context and short‐\nhand. I use about a dozen main symbols and make up more in the field as needed.

 ROB FITZPATRICK  Obstacles are preventing a customer from solving their prob‐\nlems even though they want to. They’re important because you’ll\nprobably also have to deal with them. For example, a lot of corpo‐\nrate folks would love to use cloud services and hate their current tools, but can’t, because their company’s IT policy is an obstacle.\nTheir workaround might be to use their personal phone as a\nsecondary computer or by doing certain work at home. Also worth noting.

Must-have purchasing criteria are obviously more important. Money signals\nare also key.  Write down specific names and companies. If it’s someone they know, ask for an intro at the end of the conversation. If it’s a\ncompetitororalternate solution, write itdown toresearch itlater.

 THE MOM TEST Able tobe combinedwith the notesof the restof your team  Permanentandretrievable  Notmixedin with otherrandom noise like todolists andideas In practice, I’ve found that taking notes in my primary note‐\nbook is practically useless. Over the course of several months’ sprawl, you set an insurmountable search and retrieval task for\nyourself. If youwon’tlook atyournotes, theyaren’t much good.  If you do end up taking notes in non-ideal places, you just need to spend a little extra post-meeting time moving them over\ninto your permanent format. Otherwise you’ll be kicking yourself\nwhen you don’t entirely remember that amazing quote you’d love\ntoputon your website. Whatisabetternote-taking medium? Google Docs spreadsheets and Evernote are both great for\nteam sharing, search, and retrieval. Spreadsheets are wonderfully\nsortable if you write your key signals in their own column. The downside is that it comes across as rude to take notes directly on a\ncomputer during a meeting, so you add a bit of mandatory post-\nmeeting work to transfer your notes. I always found this a bit\nannoying, but it’s way better than losing your learning in an off- topic notebook.  A dedicated notebook is fine, if you can remember to carry it\nwith you and use it. For a while, I would use my regular notebook for my customer notes and then just tear out every page which\nwasn’t from an interview so it was easier to find them later.\nHardlythe most elegant.  My favourite medium is index cards. Post-it notes also work.

ROB FITZPATRICK or learning per card (along with a signal icon, of course). After the meeting I jot down the date and who I was talking to. If your\nwhole team uses cards for their conversations, you can lay them\nall out on the table for easy access and sorting. For example, if you learn that the you’re solving a non-problem, you can just pull\nout all the cards marked with a lightning bolt and find yourself a\nnew problem thatcustomershave alreadyvalidated for you.  When I first started, I would make audio recordings, but that suffered from the same problem as notebooks: I’d end up with a\nton of content and no real way to sort it or find the bit I wanted. If\nyou do want to use audio, you’ll find people are surprisingly willing to be recorded. Put your phone on the table as you sit\ndown and say, “Hey, is it cool if I record this, because I’m always\nparanoid I’ll miss something important in my notes. It won’t get\nshared with anyone or posted anywhere.” Almost everyone says yes, butitdoesblow yourcoverif you’re trying toKeepit Casual.  If you embrace Keeping it Casual, you’ll find customer\nconversations appearing out of nowhere and catching you by surprise. Just go with it. I’ve got notes written on paper plates\nfrom a pizza party, on beer mats from the pub, and on newspa‐\npers from the cafe. Just transfer them over to your main storage system once you get back to the office. It’s better to capture\nwhat’s said on something weird than to try to remember all the\nimportant bits.  If it’s totally inappropriate to take notes during the chat, just have the conversation and then immediately retreat to a corner to\nwrite down what was said. This is how I usually handle customer\nconversationsatthe pub or conferences.

 THE MOM TEST \nAfter a batch of conversations:  Withyourteam,reviewyournotesandkeycustomer  quotes Ifrelevant,transfernotesintopermanentstorage Updateyourbeliefs and plans Decideonthenext3bigquestions  The goal of this process is twofold. First, to ensure you’re\nspending your time well by attacking the questions which really matter and making use of the brains of the whole founding team.\nSecond, to spread any new learning through your team as quickly\nandcompletelyas possible. There you go. Now you know everything I do about how to\nlearn from conversations. Combine this process with The Mom\nTest, Keeping it Casual, and Advancement for maximum learning in minimum time. But even if it goes wrong, don’t worry\nsomuch.Eternitywill forgive. \nTHIS STUFF IS FAST The time scales of the process are important. The point is to makeyourbusinessmovefaster,not slower.  Don’t spend a week prepping for meetings; spend an hour\nandthengotalktopeople.Anything moreisstalling. Don’t spend months doing full-time customer conversations\nbefore beginning to move on a product. Spend a week, maybe\ntwo. Get your bearings and then give them something to\ncommit to.

 CONCLUSION AND CHEATSHEET I still ask dumb questions all the time. You will too. Don’t beat yourself up over it. In fact, just yesterday I screwed up a particu‐\nlarly important meeting by slipping into pitch mode (this was\nyesterday at the time of writing… hopefully not again at the time of reading).  It happens. It’s okay. Review with your team, don’t beat your‐\nself up (or your cofounders) over mistakes. Work on getting better as ateam.  I make tons of mistakes. At least now I notice and have a\nchance to fix them. Most bad conversations can be fixed. You’re\ntrying to do something difficult. You’re never going to be perfect, butit always helpsto bebetter.  People love startups. Startups do cool stuff and make their\nlives better. When entrepreneurs screw up, people want to forgive them. They want the entrepreneur and the startup to\nsucceed.  By asking good questions, we can fix many flawed ideas\nbefore they get us in trouble.

Coming across the knot, Alexander drew his sword and with a single stroke, cut it in half.\nTheknotwasundoneand hebecame“the Great”.  Struggling to untie the knot was the “proper” process. Cutting through it was a hack (ba-dum tish!) which got\nAlexanderstraighttotheendresultwithoutany of the work.  When we find a new and exciting process, it’s easy to do the opposite and spend hours obsessively geeking out about exactly\ntherightwaytountiethisbig, gnarly knot.  I remember being at a workshop about customer segmenta‐ tion, a personal trainer said he was spending most of his time on\nthe non-billable commute between his clients. At some point it\nwas suggested that the police might be a better customer, since he\ncould go to the station and spend all day working with different officers. No commute, more billable hours, and a less price-sensi‐\ntivecustomer.Soundsgoodin theory!  We all started geeking out about how he was going to validate this. Who could he talk to?

 CONCLUSION AND CHEATSHEET  “Whatdowe wanttolearn from theseguys?” \nTHANKS! It’s been fun. Thanks for reading :). I hope it was helpful. For\nslides,  videos,  and  other information, check out\nmomtestbook.com. When you hit a stumbling block I can help with or learn that\nI gave some bad advice, hit me up on twitter @robfitz or via email\natrob@robfitz.com. My blog where I write about early stage startup stuff is\nthestartuptoolkit.com. Subscribe to the rss or email updates and\ndigthrough the archive. To learn to be a better founder, you’ve got to get your hands\ndirty. Startups are more craft than science. It’s something you\nlearn by doing. The tools help, but you need to get out in the field. I’ve learned more from launching silly projects than I ever\ndidfrom reading booksorblogs. Make it happen. \nAnd finally, if you’re in the business of supporting, training,\nmentoring, or investing in startups, I work with a few other\nfounders building educational curriculum (slides, workshops, videos, facilitation guides, etc) at foundercentric.com.
